        </header>
        <p>TUCSON, Ariz. &mdash; What started as a chance encounter at a speakeasy near the University of Arizona is turning
          into a lifetime commitment for Mr. Thomas Mulloy, of Tacoma, Washington, and Ms. Madeline Froning, of Tucson, Arizona.
          The couple was friends for several years before they began their courtship while the bride-to-be was living in
          the Caribbean and the future groom was residing in Chicago’s <q>Windy City</q>. They have since relocated to the
          Pacific Northwest where they hope to welcome friends and family for a Fall wedding aboard the MV Skansonia on North
          Lake Union.</p>

          <h3>Retired WA State Ferry New Life As <q>Seattle&apos;s Premier Waterfront Venue</q></h3>
          <hr class="p30" />
        </header>
        <p>TACOMA, Wash. &mdash; The story of the Skansonia begins at the Skansie Brothers Shipyard in Gig Harbor where the
          keel for a brand new ferryboat was laid on July 9, 1929. This was to be the Skansonia which was built for the run
          between Point Defiance and Gig Harbor. The Skansonia was built and ready for her engines in only six weeks time.
          After her fitting out, she began to ply the waterways of Puget Sound. She stayed with her route for ten years until
          the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was constructed at which time she began the Tahlequah to Tacoma run. But her destiny
          was not to remain on this run for long. In November of 1940, strong winds caused the collapse of the newly constructed
          Tacoma Narrows Bridge and a call went out for ferryboats to return to the narrows run. As a result, the Skansonia
          returned to the narrows run.</p>

        <p>
          In June of 1951, the Skansonia became a part of the Washington State Ferry Fleet. Her route did change, however, becoming
          the Tahlequah to Point Defiance run. She continued on this route until 1967 at which time she was retired from
          active service.In 1971 the WSF decided the Skansonia was surplus and she was listed for sale. In May 1971, the
          Skansonia was sold to Norm Volotin of Seattle who moored her on Lake Washington.</p>

        <p>The MV Skansonia was sold and given a new life to become a premier private event facility, specializing in outdoor
          or indoor weddings and receptions. She sits on the North shore of Lake Union with an unsurpassed view of Seattle
          and the Space Needle. While her outside look remains the same, she now boasts many improvements such as forced
          air heat, large bay doors that open up to the patio, fireplace downstairs, oversized furniture from a 16th century
          castle, and vintage light fixtures from the Seattle Music Theatre.</p>

        <p>Beginning in 2009 she had a complete interior redesign from head to toe. The new re-designed bathrooms, carpets,
          and freshly painted ceilings and walls keep her as a favorite venue for people seeking a truly historic piece of
          Pacific Northwest history. Perfect for any season, and accommodating to Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, and Holiday Parties
          of all sizes.</p>

          Center, tons of great shopping and incredible restaurants. It is also about a 10 minute Uber ride from our wedding

          <h3>AirBNB</h3>
          <hr class="p30" />
        </header>
        <p>As is the case in most cities these days, AirBNB is probably the most affordable option for staying in Seattle. We
          recommend looking for rentals in the following neighborhoods, both for their proximity to the venue and their local
          charm: Fremont, Queen Anne, Ballard and Capitol Hill.
        </p>
        <p>In reality, there are a lot of great places to stay in Seattle, so feel free to explore. We recommend keeping within
          a 10-15 minute ride of the venue.
