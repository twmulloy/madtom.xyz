        <h2>Seattle tourism on the rise</h2>
        <p>Millions of visitors flock to Seattle year round to enjoy all the Emerald City has to offer.  The food is fresh, the amount of rain is highly exaggerated and the beer flows like wine.  While there are no shortages of places to stay in the city, we’ve listed out a few below that we recommend to family and friends.</p>

        <h3>Hyatt Olive 8</h3>
        <p>Located downtown at Olive Way and 8th Avenue, this hotel puts you in walking distance to Pike Market, the Pier, Seattle Center, tons of great shopping and incredible restaurants.  It is also about a 10 minute uber ride from our wedding venue.</p>
        <p>We have reserved a room block at this hotel and will be staying there ourselves before and after the wedding.</p>
        <em>Insert room block info (getting from hotel)</em>

        <h3>AirBNB</h3>  
        <p>There are a lot of affordable homes and apartments available on AirBNB.  We recommend looking for rentals in the following neighborhoods, both for their proximity to the venue and their local charm:  Fremont, Queen Anne, Ballard and Capitol Hill.</p>
        <em>(insert map that shows Skanskonia and neighborhoods around it)</em>
        <p>In reality, there are a lot of great places to stay in this city, so feel free to explore.  We would just recommend staying within a 10-15 minute ride of the venue and staying in Seattle proper as opposed to Bellevue or other surrounding cities.</p>

        <h2>Good eats</h2>
        <p>You will not have any trouble finding an overwhelming amount of great restaurant options in this city.  That being said, there are a few places we recommend to all out of town guests.</p>
        <p><a href="http://beechershandmadecheese.com/Locations/Seattle.aspx" target="blank">Beecher’s</a> Handmade Cheese - located in the heart of Pike Place Market.  Their Mac & Cheese is life-changing.  They now have a location in the airport, so you can always grab a bowl on your way out of town.  Best to consume this after the wedding if you’re worried about fitting into your pants/dress.</p>
