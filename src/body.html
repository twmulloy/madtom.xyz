        <p>TUCSON, Ariz. &mdash; What started as a chance encounter at a speakeasy near the University of Arizona is turning
          into a lifetime commitment for Mr. Thomas Mulloy, of Tacoma, Washington, and Ms. Madeline Froning, of Tucson, Arizona.
          The couple was friends for several years before they began their courtship while the bride-to-be was living in
          the Caribbean and the future groom was residing in Chicago. They have since relocated to the Pacific Northwest
          where they hope to welcome friends and family for a Fall wedding aboard the MV Skansonia on North Lake Union.</p>

          <h3>Retired WA State Ferry New Life As <q>Seattle&rsquo;s Premier Waterfront Venue</q></h3>
          <hr class="p30" />
        </header>

        <p>TACOMA, Wash. &mdash; The story of the Skansonia begins at the Skansie Brothers Shipyard in Gig Harbor where the
          keel for a brand new ferryboat was laid on July 9, 1929. This was to be the Skansonia which was built for the run
          between Point Defiance and Gig Harbor. The Skansonia was built and ready for her engines in only six weeks time.
          After her fitting out, she began to ply the waterways of Puget Sound. She stayed with her route for ten years until
          the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was constructed at which time she began the Tahlequah to Tacoma run. But her destiny
          was not to remain on this run for long. In November of 1940, strong winds caused the collapse of the newly constructed
          Tacoma Narrows Bridge and a call went out for ferryboats to return to the narrows run. As a result, the Skansonia
          returned to the narrows run.</p>

        <p>In June of 1951, the Skansonia became a part of the Washington State Ferry Fleet. Her route did change, however, becoming
          the Tahlequah to Point Defiance run. She continued on this route until 1967 at which time she was retired from
          active service. In 1971 the WSF decided the Skansonia was surplus and she was listed for sale. In May 1971, the
          Skansonia was sold to Norm Volotin of Seattle who moored her on Lake Washington.</p>

        <p>The MV Skansonia was sold and given a new life to become a premier private event facility, specializing in outdoor
          or indoor weddings and receptions. She sits on the North shore of Lake Union with an unsurpassed view of Seattle
          and the Space Needle.</p>

        <p>SEATTLE, Wash. &mdash; Land of coffee, hipsters, tech companies, water, a volcano and the Space Needle. The Emerald
          City is full of energy, culture and freshly foraged cuisine. While there are no shortages of places to stay that
          take advantage of all Seattle’s unique offerings, we’ve listed out a few below that we recommend to our family
          and friends.</p>

          <h5>Hyatt Olive 8</h5>
          <hr class="blank" />
        </header>
        <p>Located downtown at Olive Way and 8th Avenue, this hotel puts you in walking distance to Pike Market, the Pier, Seattle
          Center, tons of great shopping and incredible restaurants. It is also about a 10 minute Uber ride from our wedding
          venue.
        </p>

        <p>We have reserved a room block at this hotel and will be staying there ourselves before and after the wedding. The
          last day to book a room at the <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/FroningMulloy2016" target="_blank">Hyatt Olive 8</a>          at a discounted rate is September 5<sup>th</sup>.</p>

          <hr class="blank" />
        </header>
        <p>As is the case in most cities these days, AirBNB is probably the most affordable option for staying in Seattle. We
          recommend looking for rentals in the following neighborhoods, both for their proximity to the venue and their local
          charm: Fremont, Queen Anne, Ballard and Capitol Hill.
        </p>
        <p>In reality, there are a lot of great places to stay in Seattle, so feel free to explore. We recommend keeping within
          a 10-15 minute ride of the venue.

        <p>Seattle is a city of foodies. You will not have any trouble finding tons great restaurant options. That being said,
          there are a few places we recommend to all of our out of town guests.</p>
        <hr class="p20" />
        <p><a href="http://beechershandmadecheese.com/Locations/Seattle.aspx" target="blank">Beecher&rsquo;s</a> Handmade Cheese
          &mdash; Located in the heart of Pike Place Market. Their Mac &amp; Cheese is life-changing. They now have a location
          in the airport, so you can always grab a bowl on your way out of town.</p>
        <hr class="blank" />

        <p><a href="http://www.pikeplacechowder.com/#!locations/c18rj" target="blank">Pike Place Chowder</a> &mdash; Also in
          the Market. You really can’t go wrong here with anything, but the New England Clam and the Smoked Salmon chowders
          are definite favorites.</p>
        <hr class="blank" />

        <p><a href="http://www.shikijapaneserestaurant.com" target="blank">Shiki</a> Japanese Restaurant &mdash; Located in
          Lower Queen Anne. After experiencing all that Seattle has to offer for sushi you cannot go wrong with any place,
          but Shiki is hands down the best and most legit offering. While in season, Shiki is the only place in the Pacific
          Northwest that serves Fugu <q>PNWではフグが頂けるのが四季だけなのでこの機会をお見逃しなく</q>.</p>

        <hr class="blank" />

        <p>Part of the reason we booked the wedding on a Friday was so that our out of town guests can spend the rest of the weekend exploring the city.  You can find a lot of recommendations online, but below are a few places to consider checking out.</p>

        <hr class="p20" />

        <p>Pike Place Market &mdash; for delicious reasons outlined above.</p>

        <hr class="blank" />
        <p>Ferry or water taxi &mdash; take a water taxi to explore West Seattle (and if you do head to Sunfish for fish & chips)
          or take a ferry to explore Bainbridge Island. Both leave from the piers just below downtown Seattle.</p>
        <hr class="blank" />
        <p>Seattle Center &mdash; See the Space Needle up close and check out Chihuly Garden & Glass if you are into enormous
          hand-blown glass installations. Also home of the EMP (Experience Music Project).</p>
        <hr class="blank" />
        <p>Take a walk &mdash; Enjoy the three-mile loop around <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-lake-park-seattle" target="_blank">Green Lake</a>,
          the six-mile stroll around <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/chesiahud-lake-union-loop" target="_blank">Lake Union</a>,
          or walk along the piers to <a href="http://www.weissmanfredi.com/project/seattle-art-museum-olympic-sculpture-park"
          target="_blank">Olympic Sculpture Park</a> for views of Puget Sound and some interesting artwork.</p>
